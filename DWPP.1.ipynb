Knowing how to ask the user for input is not only useful, but allows us to think about the type of data we're getting, how to convert it into a format we can use, and what the format would be.\n",

        "As you might know, Python only provides two kinds of loops: `for` and `while`. Knowing how to write and use them will serve you well throughout your Python career. The fact that nearly every type of data knows how to work inside a `for loop` makes such loops common and useful. If you're working with database records, elements in a file, or the results from searching for text using regular expressions, you'll be using `for loops` quite a bit.\n",

You should therefore save all the progress that you make here by having it open in Google Colab, making the changes there, by selecting \"File\"->\"Save a Copy to GitHub\". For a detailed explanation on all the steps required for saving a project, watch this video: [How to save your progress](https://bit.ly/3mD1Xme)\n",
        "\n",
        "To open this notebook in Google Colab, use the Google Colab button in the Turing Platform. The first time you open a Github repository through Google Colab can be a bit messy, though. We recommend either watching [this video](https://bit.ly/3lomUSF) or following the instructions below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Go to http://colab.research.google.com/github, and check the ‘Include private repos’ box. If you see any error messages, keep clicking ‘Retry.’ You should eventually authenticate with your Github account and see your GitHub username & have ‘Include private repos’ checked.\n",
        "2. Close the window & click ‘Google Colab’ on the platform. You might continue to see Authentication error messages. Just go through them by clicking ‘Retry’ and authenticating with your GitHub account.\n",
        "3. At some point, you are likely to see a pop-up being blocked. Allow all pop-ups from Google Colab in your browser.\n",

        "Before submitting your project, double check that you have saved your progress to your GitHub repository. A good way to do that is to open the GitHub link to your repository (available in the Turing Platform) instead of the Google Colab one, or by simply refreshing the platform and checking if the notebook preview has your updates. If you see the changes there, you are good to go! Note that reviewers are allowed to only evaluate the work that you have submitted,and that once you submit your project, you are no longer allowed to make any changes, so this step is really important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have completed a project and double-checked that it is saved in your GitHub repository, go to the Turing Platform and click the button to complete it. The platform then allows you to see the times when reviewers are available to have a call with you and review the project. Simply book a time that suits you. If there are no times available, feel free to message us in the [#education_support](https://discord.com/channels/722762519911071744/769151570687688704) channel on Discord — we will make sure that a reviewer adds a time for you.\n",

        "The most common structure for a code review is for the learner to go through their project while sharing their screen, presenting how each part was done and what insights were achieved. The reviewer asks questions to check whether the learner really understands the relevant parts of the project, and assigns a rating from 1 to 5 for each of the evaluation criteria. On average, a review like this takes 40 minutes to complete, but the time can differ based on the project and amount of feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of a correction is to test the current limits of your knowledge and give you personalised feedback on how to improve further. Expect the reviewer to give you tips on how to improve things, even if you did everything perfectly according to the criteria. We also very strongly advise you to let the reviewer know if you feel unsure about some parts of your knowledge, instead of trying to hide it — this is the best way to improve as the reviewer will be able to confirm or reject your assumptions, while you will not be losing anything by potentially getting a lower score.\n",
        "\n",
        "To pass a correction and unlock the next sprint, you need to achieve a score of 70% or more. If you fail the project, you will be given write access to your repository once again and will be expected to make adjustments based on the feedback received. Once the changes are made, you will be able to submit the project once again and schedule a new code review — as mentioned before, a low score, even a failing one, is nothing to worry about, as you will be able to move forward as soon as you are ready to do so.\n",
